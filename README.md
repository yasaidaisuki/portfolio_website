## My Process :bread:

This is my offical portfolio website! The original idea was by a japanese web developer going by, Bokoko33. He has some really interesting work so please check out him out! 

The original code is from Andrew Woan who has a uploaded tutorial on how to make the whole website. 

Some highlights from making this website is definitely creating my "own room" using Blender. Everything you see in the website was designed by myself, as you can see little items and trinkets that highlight my interests and personality!

I really learnt a lot doing this project, as I got a taste of how far javascript and different technologies such as Lerping, GSAP, and Three.JS can really bring a very standard HTML website to life. 

Coding this project, I experimented with 3-D curves and how to interact with the vectors such that I can move the camera in a bunch of whacky and interesting angles.  

One thing I was really enticed in was the real-time lighting that Three.JS offered. I messed around with different lighting sources (spotlights, directional lights, ambient light, ect.) You can indeed mess around with the lighting using the dark-mode and your mouse.
